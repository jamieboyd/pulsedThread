# pulsed Thread
PulsedThread is a C++ class that uses the POSIX pthread library to set up and control a threaded task for precise, independent timing of events that can be categorized as pulses or trains of pulses; the events correspond to transitions between the HIGH periods and LOW periods of the pulses.
PyPulsedThread contains a collection of functions for controlling a pulsedThread object wrapped in a PyCapsule. It is useful for building Python C-modules controlling pulsedThread objects.
